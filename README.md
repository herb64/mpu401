# My old MIDI project for OS/2

Here goes my old MIDI software project, I found on my old backups. This includes a device driver for OS/2 for the intelligent MIDI
Interface card MPU-401, written in assembler as well as some OS/2 Presentation Manager code.


## The device driver

As the OS/2 system did not contain a hires timer at that time, the MPU card was a way to get timing done using an interrupt driven
system.

## The OS/2 program

This never got finished, because OS/2 was abandoned by IBM.
